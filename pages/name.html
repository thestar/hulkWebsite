			<h5 style="color: steelblue;">Movie Review</h5>
			<p>A black slave who was about to be trafficked, with the help of a bounty hunter, saves his wife after killing countless whites in a manor. This scene appears in Django Unchained, which is directed by Quentin Tarantino. The three main characters are Jamie Foxx as Django, Christoph Waltz as a bounty hunter, Leonardo DiCaprio as the owner of the estate. The movie is set on the eve of the Civil War, when a bounty hunter seeks the help of Django in order to kill the people on the bounty hunt. Later, with the help of this friend, Django goes on to save his wife. This movie reflects the spirit of black resistance to oppression.</p>

			<p>The characters in this film have distinct personalities, and everyone plays their roles perfectly. In the movie, the bounty hunter’s scenes look out of place every time he kills someone, for example killing the sheriff without saying a word in front of a bar. However, the people he killed were on the reward list, and they were all notorious criminals. Many of his seemingly sinister moves were tried without breaking the law. Director Quentin shows the German character of playing by the rules in this movie. In addition, as the rescuer and guide of Django, this German runs through the whole process of the film, which reflects the growth of the rebellious spirit of Django from the side. As the protagonist of the film, Django’s rescue of his wife was his struggle against the unequal racial system and distorted values in the United States at that time. Django is not a just character because he kills many innocent people. behind Django’s brutish revenge journey, are the extremes of the black slave era, with no absolute justice or evil. </p>
			<p>The details in the film make the film still ironic and realistic in today’s society. In the movie, Django’s surname is Freeman, which is a homonym for Freeman. It represents a black slave who breaks the chain of racial bondage and pursues racial equality. Before Django went back to the manor again, he took the saddle off his horse. American cowboys must have a saddle on their horse, but this detail of Django represents a rebellion in the bones. The opposite of Django is the butler of the manor, who is also a black man, but he is very respectful to the white people, and extremely strict and cruel to the black maids. He knew the gap between black and white, but he chose to be a loyal slave. These details show that obedience is the most terrible slavishness and the biggest stumbling block to equality. 
			</p>
			<p>Django is not the first time to appear in the film. However, Director Quentin combined the story of some black slaves who pursued freedom and fought against the white people, absorbed the essence of these films, and created a more distinctive image of the black rebel. Unlike Selma's non-violent demonstrations, Django Unchained gives the audience a different look and feel by using violent resistance. There are many ways to resist, but the most important is to resist and pursue the spirit of freedom and equality. I give this movie a score of 9 out of 10. The reason for that 1 point is that there are some melodramatic plots in the movie, but it's probably for satire</p>
